# Portfolio Site – Development Process  
Live: https://ainsleyfreedman01.github.io/PortfolioSite/

## Why I Built This  
This site started as a way to have a central place for my projects and experience, but it quickly became more about improving my front-end skills through practice.  

I didn’t start with wireframes or a full plan — I built the site by coding, testing, adjusting, breaking things, and fixing them. A big part of the value was learning by doing.

## Tech Stack  
- **HTML5** – structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – styling, layout control, and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – light interactivity  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control  
- **GitHub Pages** – deployment and hosting

## How I Actually Built It  

### 1. Build-As-I-Go Approach  
Instead of wireframing, I designed while coding:
- Started with basic structure  
- Added one section at a time  
- Visually tested in the browser  
- Adjusted spacing, layout, and appearance through trial and error  

This helped me understand how design decisions translate directly into code changes.

---

### 2. Layout & Structure  
I focused on:
- Writing clean, readable HTML  
- Using useful class names so my CSS stayed organized  
- Separating structure (HTML) from style (CSS) instead of mixing them  

This project really reinforced how important good structure is before making something look good.

### 3. CSS & Styling  
All styling was done manually with CSS — no frameworks.  

Most of the time went into:
- Getting spacing, margins, and alignment right  
- Making sure fonts and colors felt consistent  
- Avoiding cluttered or overly busy design  

I also learned how much small CSS changes can drastically affect the overall feel of a site.

### 4. Responsive Design  
I worked on responsiveness mainly by:
- Resizing my browser constantly  
- Using media queries  
- Fixing layouts when they broke on smaller screens  

Instead of designing mobile-first or desktop-first, I just continuously adjusted as problems appeared — which helped me understand *why* responsiveness matters, not just how to do it.

---

### 5. JavaScript  
JavaScript was used only where necessary, mainly to:
- Add interactivity  
- Improve navigation or UI behavior  
- Keep the site feeling dynamic instead of static  

I prioritized keeping the JS understandable and minimal.

---

### 6. Version Control  
This project helped me practice:
- Making frequent commits instead of big dumps  
- Tracking changes when I tried new ideas  
- Reverting things when an experiment didn’t work  

It helped me treat coding as an iterative process instead of something that has to be perfect the first time.

---

## Challenges  
Some real challenges I ran into:
- Getting elements to align properly across screen sizes  
- Fixing spacing inconsistencies  
- Not overcomplicating the design  
- Debugging CSS when small changes caused unexpected layout shifts  

These forced me to slow down and actually understand what my code was doing.

---

## What I Learned  
Building this site improved my understanding of:
- HTML/CSS fundamentals in real project settings  
- How responsive behavior actually works  
- Debugging layout problems without relying on frameworks  
- How small design decisions affect usability  
- How to deploy and maintain a live site
